1. Create or join a DAO (branding, privacy, SSO, ZK)
2. Onboard and federate (parent/child DAOs, SSO, ZK)
3. Propose, vote, analyze (AI and privacy layers)
4. Collaborate, review, test (PRs, testing, coverage, continuous audit)
5. Manage assets (multi-safe, NFTs, time-locked allocations)
6. Community & bounties (cross-DAO, AI scoring, forum)
7. Analyze & export (dashboards, transparency, compliance)
